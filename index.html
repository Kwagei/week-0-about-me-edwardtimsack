    <h1>KIT EXPERIENCE</h1>
    <p>To begin with, I want to extend my deepest gratitude to the Kwagei Innovator Training Family.<br>
    I'm so excited or amazed to be one of your students.<br>
    The program is so unique and challenging, this saying is always noted.<br>"That things will never get easy but you will be better".<br>
    In addition, this environment has been a whole new way of learning but <br>gradually things will be settle down as quickly has possible
    I've seen the differences and distinction of various learning atmosphere.<br> around me compare to ours, the bigger picture has already been shown and more to come.<br><br>
    Futhermore, KIT had introduced the medium of studying in many ways, especially reading frequently.<br> Going through sleepless night, allowing me to always ask questions whether dumb or essential.<br>
    It has helped me to always find a way of resolving BUDS or solution on my own.<br> The program has atleast help me to put more time in coding or practice.<br>
    Not forgetting I will never allow my schooling interfer with my EDUCATION!</p>
